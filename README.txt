A simple calculator to calculate percentage.

To use it, enter a number and a percentage in the corresponding positions. Click on “Push Me” 
button to jump to another screen to see the result.  

This App can run on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow).

What I learned from it:
It is my first App and also my first time to use Java. It’s quite simple but I do learned a lot.
1. How to add images to Android Studio.
2. How to move from one screen to another with “Intent”
3. How to pass values from one Activity to another with “Bundle”.	 
4. How to use EditText, TextView, Button, etc.
5. How to use constraints. 
6. How to rename the project.
7. Use Android Studio to add projects to Github directly.
